CJLog
=====
This library provides a lightweight, system independent logging facility to multiple destinations.
Written in Kotlin, it can also be used in Java projects. A logging destination can be to a file, via HTTP to a local host,
to the system's logging facility or wherever else you like - a new type of destination can be added by implementing
a simple interface.
